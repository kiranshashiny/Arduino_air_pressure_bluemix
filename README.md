# Arduino_air_pressure_bluemix


Connecting the Arduino Genuino to the Air Pressure sensor as part of an investigation why facial sinus increases during rainy seasons or damp weather.

The code can be modified to any region on earth by looking up the altitude and changing the ALTITUDE in the example code.

The code in this is for Bangalore - which is about 920 meters above sea level.
